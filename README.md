# Black-Friday-Sales

Black Friday is the Friday following by the
Thanksgiving. Retailers and store owners offer
great promotions for almost every items to boost
the sale amount and take this chance to clear
inventory. For buyers, this is the deal of the year
that will save you a lot of money to purchase
new furniture, electronics, or even Christmas
gift! Literally anything you can think of. From
a sellerâ€™s perspective, the sales record can be
renewed if they are able to come up with a better
propaganda or a tailor-made selling strategy for
each customer by utilizing the sales record from
the past. For consumers, will more likely to know
what are the hot products in this season and get
an idea of what to get before the deals are gone.
In either way, both parties will get benefit from a
proper analysis.
